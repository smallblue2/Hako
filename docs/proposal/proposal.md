> Ensure that the Supervisor formally agrees to supervise your project; this is only recognised once the
> Supervisor assigns herself/himself via the project Dashboard.
>
> Project proposals without an assigned
> Supervisor will not be accepted for presentation to the Approval Panel.

## SECTION B

> Guidance: This document is expected to be approximately 3 pages in length, but it can exceed this page limit.
> It is also permissible to carry forward content from this proposal to your later documents (e.g. functional
> specification) as appropriate.
>
> Your proposal must include *at least* the following sections.


### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.

### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?

### Achievements

#### Target Users
Hoku is an educational tool designed for individuals learning programming concepts. However, our primary audience **children**, and we will craft the user interface and overall experience with their needs in mind.

Additionally, **teachers and mentors** will play a key role by using Hoku to guide students and assign programming tasks.

Our target demographic is split into two groups;
 - **Students (Ages 9 - 17)** - Engaging young learners in systems and programming concepts.
 - **Mentors**- While thereâ€™s no specific age range for mentors, we assume a certain level of technical proficiency.

#### Functions Provided
##### User Interface
The user interface will simulate a familiar operating system, tailored specifically to the needs of children. Our goal is to create an environment that is **fun, intuitive, and immersive**, tricking the user into believing they are interacting with a full-fledged OS.

Key features include:
 - **Floating Window Manager**
 - **Desktop Environment**
 - **Toolbar**

##### Core Apps
The system will come equipped with essential, built-in apps designed to teach programming and system interaction. These core apps will include (but are not limited to):
 - **Text Editor**
 - **Terminal**
 - **Shell**
 - **Task System**
 - **Settings Wizard**

##### Execution Environment
In order to teach children programming concepts, and to further allow them to interact with our system, we will need to create an execution environment that allows children to execute arbitrary code. 

Although we could support multiple different languages, we will first support the **Lua programming language** due to its lightweight and embeddable nature.

##### Filesystem
A filesystem is crucial for students to manage their progress and save their work. However, due to the sensitive nature of our target demographic, we will not store any user data. Instead, users will be able to **download their filesystem state** at the end of a session or **upload it** when starting one, ensuring privacy and control over their own data. 

### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?

### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.

### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.

### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.

#### Student 1

> *Student 1 should complete this section.*

#### Student 2

> *Student 2 should complete this section.*
