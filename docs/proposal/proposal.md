> Ensure that the Supervisor formally agrees to supervise your project; this is only recognised once the
> Supervisor assigns herself/himself via the project Dashboard.
>
> Project proposals without an assigned
> Supervisor will not be accepted for presentation to the Approval Panel.

## SECTION B

> Guidance: This document is expected to be approximately 3 pages in length, but it can exceed this page limit.
> It is also permissible to carry forward content from this proposal to your later documents (e.g. functional
> specification) as appropriate.
>
> Your proposal must include *at least* the following sections.


### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.

### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?

### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?

### Justification

#### Why?
We have identified significant gaps in the current methods used to teach programming, particularly in the area of **systems literacy**. Most existing platforms focus on teaching how to code, but rarely emphasize understanding the environment in which that code runs. Without this foundational knowledge, students are limited in their ability to troubleshoot, reason about system behaviour, and become well-rounded programmers. Hako seeks to **bridge this gap** by teaching children to engage with and manipulate systems, not just write code.

#### When and Where?
Hako will be useful in **educational settings** where programming concepts are being introduced, such as:
 - **Classrooms and lab environments**: Teachers can use Hako to demonstrate how systems work and assign tasks that build on that knowledge.
 - **After-school coding programs**: Environments like CoderDojo can leverage Hako to enhance the systems literacy of young coders.
 - **Home-based learning**: Independent learners can use Hako to explore and practice coding in a fun and interactive way, supported by a rich systems-level experience.

#### How?
Hako accomplishes its educational mission by creating a **simplified system environment** with a **custom API**. This stripped-back operating system allows children to interact directly with the system, offering an experience similar to native development but without the complications of hardware dependencies. Additionally, there will be a **task system** allowing mentors to share tasks to their students, and even encouraging students to share their own problems amongst eachother. By leveraging this platform, students can:
 - **Run code in real-time** through an interactive execution environment.
 - **Learn core systems concepts** through built-in applications like a text editor, terminal, and task system.
 - **Manage their projects** with a serializable filesystem that ensures privacy and security for young learners.
 - **Experience immediate feedback** from system interactions, mimicking real-world operating systems to make the learning process intuitive and rewarding.
 - **Complete, create and share tasks** from our custom task system, enabling mentors to push tasks onto their students systems, even allowing children to share their own interesting tasks.

### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.

### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.

### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.

#### Student 1

> *Student 1 should complete this section.*

#### Student 2

> *Student 2 should complete this section.*
