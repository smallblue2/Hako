## SECTION A

|                     |                   |
|---------------------|-------------------|
|Project Title:       | xxxxxx            |
|Student 1 Name:      | xxxxxx            |
|Student 1 ID:        | xxxxxx            |
|Student 2 Name:      | xxxxxx            |
|Student 2 ID:        | xxxxxx            |
|Project Supervisor:  | xxxxxx            |

> Ensure that the Supervisor formally agrees to supervise your project; this is only recognised once the
> Supervisor assigns herself/himself via the project Dashboard.
>
> Project proposals without an assigned
> Supervisor will not be accepted for presentation to the Approval Panel.

## SECTION B

> Guidance: This document is expected to be approximately 3 pages in length, but it can exceed this page limit.
> It is also permissible to carry forward content from this proposal to your later documents (e.g. functional
> specification) as appropriate.
>
> Your proposal must include *at least* the following sections.


### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.

Accessiblity of computers is as high as ever, and still rising, no longer do you need specialized skills to make use of a computer. While this has its obvious benefits for broader humanity, for those who are looking into more specialized areas in Computing, the level of abstraction that is presented leaves a complex and difficult system to understand, we consider this a barrier to *Systems Literacy*.

We believe that *Systems Literacy* is a crucial part of computer science as it motivates otherwise mundane tasks as a challenge in understanding the underlying systems at play. We want to shift the perspective of code to be a means for extracting value from computers, rather than a disjoint activity, whos output is disconnected from the system you are interacting with.

To achieve this we propose a design of a simpler, platform-agnostic system that is constrained by design. The goal of which is to promote programming of the very environment you are using to write code.

### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?

### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?

### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?

### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.

### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.

### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.

#### Student 1

> *Student 1 should complete this section.*

#### Student 2

> *Student 2 should complete this section.*
